Github Bathrode
===============

Github has given us the ubiquitous [Octocat](http://octodex.github.com/) which now features on [hoodies](http://shop.github.com/products/octocat-hoodie), [mugs](http://shop.github.com/products/octobiwan-mug) and [coasters](http://shop.github.com/products/cork-coasters) but strangely enough, not on bathrobes.

This needs fixing.

But Why?
--------

TL;DR: [Towel Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towel_Day)

Perhaps it would be more appropriate to have a Github towel but a good towel is a waste without a matching bathrobe. Also, anyway who has read [The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker's_Guide_to_the_Galaxy) will know that [Arthur Dent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Dent) spent the entire novel in a bathrobe. Hence, no good [Towel Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towel_Day) can be without a bathrobe ... a github:bathrobe!

Bathrobes are extremely Comfortable
-----------------------------------

Bathrobes are the single most underestimated piece of clothing on the planet. They are extremely comfortable, low maintenance and very undemanding. In addition they come in also sorts of colors (of course, the github bathrobe *must* be black), they don't need tailoring - they just fit.

Protoype
--------

To prove the point, a prototype has been developed in hours of intense work. This protoype features ... well it's a bathrobe so you know what the features are :)
